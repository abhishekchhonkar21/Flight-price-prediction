# Flight Price Prediction

### Project Highlights:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensured data quality by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like day of the week, month, and flight duration from existing data for improved model performance.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used visualizations to understand price distributions and feature correlations.

- **Model Selection and Training:** Tested multiple models including Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree. Used techniques like hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV for optimal model performance.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.

### Conclusion:
The "Flight Price Prediction" project demonstrates effective application of machine learning techniques to predict airline ticket prices accurately. By leveraging various models and rigorous evaluation metrics, it provides valuable insights into pricing dynamics within the aviation industry.
